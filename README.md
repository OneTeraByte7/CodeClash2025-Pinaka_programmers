## üéØ Project Overview

This AI-powered **Collision Detection System** addresses the critical challenge of real-world vehicle accidents, which are often caused by inefficient sensors and insufficient training data. By leveraging **custom-built machine learning models** trained on a **self-generated, high-fidelity dataset**, this project provides a robust solution for predicting and preventing collisions in real-time.

The system analyzes vehicle dynamics‚Äîsuch as velocity, speed, and angle‚Äîalong with other risk factors to deliver timely warnings and enhance driver safety.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Live Collision Detection**: Utilizes OpenCV for real-time video capture from webcams or video files to predict potential crashes by analyzing vehicle telemetry.
*   **Lane-Based Collision Model**: Implements a specialized model to detect and warn about risks associated with lane departures and unsafe lane changes.
*   **High-Accuracy Custom Dataset**: Trained on a unique, self-generated dataset that mirrors real-world driving scenarios, leading to more reliable predictions.
*   **Post-Ride Analysis**: Offers a comprehensive ride report after each session, including detailed accuracy calculations and performance metrics.
*   **Persistent Model Training**: Saves trained models as `.pkl` files, allowing for continuous learning and improvement over time without retraining from scratch.
*   **Real-time Video Processing**: Employs `OpenCV` for efficient video rendering, object tracking, and data visualization.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The system follows a multi-stage process to ensure accurate collision detection:

1.  **Data Generation**: A custom dataset is generated to simulate various driving scenarios, capturing key metrics like speed, angle, and proximity to other vehicles.
2.  **Model Training**: Machine learning models (from Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow) are trained on this dataset to learn the patterns that precede a collision. The trained models are serialized and saved as `.pkl` files.
3.  **Real-time Video Input**: The system captures video from a live webcam or a pre-recorded file using OpenCV.
4.  **Object Detection & Tracking**: Vehicles and lanes are identified and tracked across frames.
5.  **Feature Extraction**: For each detected vehicle, real-time data (velocity, angle, etc.) is extracted.
6.  **Prediction**: The trained model processes these features to calculate a real-time risk score and predict the likelihood of a collision.
7.  **Alerting & Visualization**: The system provides on-screen alerts and visualizes the tracking and risk assessment on the video feed.
